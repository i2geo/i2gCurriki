<content>1 About the i2geo Platform

The i2geo platform is a part of the intergeo project, grouping many partners of interactive geometry of Europe within an EU funded project dedicated to make interactive geometry interoperable. The role of this platform is to stimulate *cross-curriculum-exchanges*.

The i2geo platform is hosted by [DFKI GmbH &gt; http://ccel.dfki.de/] and is based on the [Curriki platform &gt; http://www.curriki.org/], an enrichment of [XWiki &gt; http://www.xwiki.org/] for exchanging educational resources.

1 Differences of i2geo and Curriki

While Curriki is a project dedicated to any type of learning material, the i2geo platform is dedicated to interactive geometry. This specialization allows this platform to offer extra services for interactive geometry users, in particular:

- annotations and search by fine grained competencies and topics of the mathematics curriculum standards of Europe (in progress, see [comped &gt; http://draft.i2geo.net/comped], [skills-text-box &gt; http://draft.i2geo.net/SearchI2G/], and the many embeddings)
- insertion of java and flash applets within the Currikulum editor so that interactive geometry resources can be authored on the platform (in progress, see [construction services tasks &gt; http://jira.activemath.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;mode=hide&amp;pid=10070&amp;sorter/order=DESC&amp;sorter/field=priority&amp;resolution=-1&amp;component=10261]
- insertion of mathematical formul√¶ (see issue [IG-16 &gt; http://jira.activemath.org/browse/IG-16])

(below is the rest of About Curriki, it needs update, see [IG-10 &gt;http://jira.activemath.org/browse/IG-10].

Curriki is more than your average Website; we're a community of educators, learners and committed education experts who are working together to create quality materials that will benefit teachers and students around the world.

Curriki is an online environment created to support the development and free distribution of world-class educational materials to anyone who needs them. Our name is a play on the combination of 'curriculum' and 'wiki' which is the technology we're using to make education universally accessible.

#subtitlebar("Curriki is a Community" "See our partners" "Main.Partners" "purple")
In addition to members like you, we have support and funding from a variety of partners. These are individuals and organizations that are convinced that making world-class materials freely available to educators around the world is a key part of improving children's learning.

These early members and supporters are educators and organizations that believe in Curriki's approach of using technology to provide freely available learning resources. They have generously allowed us to utilize existing materials and have created resources especially for Curriki, as well.
