# Within a page, one can use such a message
# with \$msg.get("phrasename")

# Documents that need to be translated as well are:
# - /Main/WebHome
# - /Traces/WebHome
# for value-spaces:
# - all topics (mostly the title)
# - all licenses (mostly the title)
#
# In principle all sheets are multilingual.
# - juridictions?
